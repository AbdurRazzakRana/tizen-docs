# Tizen-enabled SOM [SDT-A7X2-M4]

![Architecture](media/sdt.png)

Gateway SOM based on Arm¢ç Cortex¢ç-A7 dual core and another Cortex¢ç-M4 core, where the former one is for high-performance processing and the latter one is for real-time application performance. It also provides 512MB DDR3L-1600 DRAM and 8GB eMMC NAND Flash. 

With Secure Element (SE), SDT-A7X2-M4 ensures high security. The modules supports Arm Mbed Linux OS and Samsung Tizen, and can be directly connected to Arm Pelion and Samsung SmartThings.
