# GBS (Git Build System)

GBS (git-build-system) is a command line tool that supports Tizen package development. It is used to generate tarballs based on Git repositories, to do local test buildings, and to submit code to OBS (Tizen's main build service).

Before going into further GBS details, make sure you have [set up the development environment](../../developing/setting-up.md) and learned how to [install and upgrade tools](../../developing/installing.md).

Afterwards, become familiar with GBS by reading the following instructions:

- [GBS Configuration](gbs.conf.md) describes how to modify the GBS configuration.
- [GBS Reference](gbs-reference.md) describes, in more detail, how to use GBS.
- [GBS Frequently Asked Questions](gbs-faq.md) describes frequently asked questions.
