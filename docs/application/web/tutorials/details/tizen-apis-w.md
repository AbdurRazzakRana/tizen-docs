# Tizen APIs

Using the Tizen Web API modules, you can develop rich Web applications
and build great application experiences with well-known Web programming
languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Like every major browser in the
market, the Tizen Web API modules support the latest HTML5 capabilities,
such as animation, offline, audio, and video. By utilizing the standard
HTML5 capabilities, your Web applications are ready to run across
various devices and platforms with minimal customization. In addition to
the JavaScript-based Tizen Device API, you can also enable advanced
device access from your Web applications, such as Bluetooth and NFC.

The Tizen platform supports hybrid applications (1 Web application and 1
or more native applications). A hybrid application package is very
useful for Web applications that need background processing or
monitoring. With a hybrid application package, you can register the
included applications in the Tizen Store and install, update, and
uninstall them using a single hybrid package. For more information on
developing hybrid Web applications with Tizen devices, see [Packaging
Hybrid Applications](../process/app-dev-process-w.md#hybrid).

Tizen provides a wide range of Web API modules that allow you to take
full advantage of various Tizen features.
