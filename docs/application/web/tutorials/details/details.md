# Understanding Tizen Programming

When designing Tizen Web applications, you need to take into account the
following programming concepts:

-   [Tizen APIs](tizen-apis.md)
-   [Security and API Privileges](sec-privileges.md)
-   [Application Filtering](app-filtering.md)
-   [API Versioning and Deprecation Policy of the Tizen
    Platform](deprecation-policy.md)
-   [Web Runtime](web-runtime.md)
-   [Event Handling](event-handling.md) (in **wearable applications
    only**)
-   [Application Signing and Certificates](sign-certificate.md)
