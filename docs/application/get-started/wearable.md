# Get Started with Tizen Wearable Applications
Tizen targets to provide a robust development environment to explore the future of innovative smart wearable application development. 
For wearable devices, Tizen supports three primary application types, .NET, Web, and Native applications.

## Wearable .NET Applications
You can create rich applications in C# using the .NET framework benefits that contribute to secure and efficient application development. 

To begin with, you can use the following quick start guides:
-   [Wearable .NET application](../dotnet/get-started/wearable/first-app.md)
-   [Wearable XAML application](../dotnet/get-started/wearable/first-xaml-app.md)

Ensure that you have installed the latest version of [Visual Studio Tools for Tizen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tizen.VSToolsforTizen).
