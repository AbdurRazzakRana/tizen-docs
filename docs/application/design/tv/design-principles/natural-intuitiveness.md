# Natural Intuitiveness

Enhance the usability and make the interface naturally familiar to the user by, for example, using [shadow effects](natural-intuitiveness/shadow-effect.md). This allows the user to access content and information easily with a pleasing natural visual balance.

## Shadow Effect

Shadow effects can add subtle but clear emphasis to generated items. The effect is natural and consequently also harmonizes with the content. The user can focus better without any visual strain.
