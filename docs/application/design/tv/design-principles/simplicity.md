# Simplicity

Using many decorative elements on the screen at the same time can
confuse and distract the user.

Simplify your application design to allow the user to clearly identify the content:

-   [Use circular icons](#Circular-Icons)
-   [Hide inactive icons](#Hidden-Inactive-Icons)
-   [Avoid unnecessary decorations](#No-Unnecessary-Decorations)


## Circular Icons

Tizen 4.0 TV icons are circular, covering a smaller area than
rectangular icons. Consequently, the user can see more of the screen
background.

*Circular icons taking less space on the screen.*


## Hidden Inactive Icons

An inactive icon partly hides itself to take up even less space on the screen. This approach also allows the user to recognize active icons without visual interruption from inactive icons.

*Inactive icons are hidden.*


## No Unnecessary Decorations

Within functional design elements, clean up unnecessary decorations, such as a divider bar. Instead, use more functionally-effective visual expressions or separate information. It makes the UI look cleaner and more organized.

*No divider bar between different pieces of information.*
