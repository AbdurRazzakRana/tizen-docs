# Recommendations

Recommendations are not strict rules, but you should follow them anyway, when possible.

The following recommendations apply to the Tizen 4.0 TV platform:

-   [Always show the focus](recommendations/show-focus-always.md) on the screen
-   [Make a partial screen partial](recommendations/define-screen-size-based-on-layer.md)
-   [Provide confirmation](recommendations/provide-confirmation.md) for crucial actions
