# Define Screen Size Based on Layer

To keep the user fully aware of the current screen:

-   The full screen has history information, and it is located on the main screen layer of each application. Consequently, the full screen must be full-sized.
-   The partial screen has no history and appears temporarily. To clearly differentiate the partial screen from the full screen, make it smaller than the full screen.
