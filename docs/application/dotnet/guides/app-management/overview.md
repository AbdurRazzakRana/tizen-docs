# Application Management

The application management features cover application resources, the communication methods available for the application, and getting application information.

You can use the following application management features in your .NET applications:

- [Application Icons](app-icons.md)

  You can show the application icon as a shortcut on the home screen to allow the user to easily access it. In the device application list, you can show a badge with the application icon to provide additional information about the application state or notifications to the user.

- [Application Controls](app-controls.md)

  The application controls allow you to share an application's functionality. Using another application's features through application controls reduces the time and effort needed to develop your own application. You can also allow other applications to share your functionality by exporting your application control functionalities.

- [Application Manager](app-manager.md)

  You can retrieve information about the applications installed on the device. You can also get information about the currently-running application.

- [Package Manager](package-manager.md)

  You can retrieve information about the packages installed on the device. You can also monitor for changes in the device packages.

- [Application Data Exchange](app-communication.md)

  The application can communicate with other applications in various ways. You can exchange data between applications through message ports and data controls.
