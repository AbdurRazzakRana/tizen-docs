# UI Components

UI components are interactive components for layouting and scrolling the user interface. In Tizen NUI documentation, both the terms **control** and **component** are used to refer to a UI component.

NUI provides various UI components which you can use in your application views. For example:

-   [Button](button.md)

    You can display various buttons: a push button that can be pressed, a check box button that can be checked and unchecked, a selectable radio button (which allows only one button in a group of buttons to be selected), and a toggle button that can be switch on and off.

-   [Flex container](flexcontainer.md)

    You can use a flax container to gather responsive elements within a container, to be automatically arranged on different size screens or devices.

-   [Image view](imageview.md)

    You can display an image.

-   [Text label](textlabel.md)

    You can display a short text string.

You can create [custom views](creating-custom-view-controls.md) and [customize the look of the UI components with JSON stylesheets](styling-controls-with-JSON.md). For a reusable rendering logic that can be used by all UI components, take advantage of [visuals](visuals.md).
