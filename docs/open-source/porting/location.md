# Location

## Location Framework

Location provides location based services (LBS) including the position information, satellite information and GPS status.

[![Location.png](https://wiki.tizen.org/images/3/30/Location.png)](./media/Location.png)

You can use the following location featuresÂ´:

- GPS (Global positioning system)
- Getting the current position, last known position, accuracy, distance and velocity
- Getting the satellite information of GPS and GLONASS
- Notifying a user when they enter or exit a predefined set of boundaries, known as geofence, like school attendance zones or neighborhood boundaries


- Location framework


- location-manager




- Location Library
  - Contains the location providers that can be used by the location-manager to get the services.
  - GPS
    - GPS provides position information, velocity and satellite information. It is used to get the current position of a device.
- dbus
  - This is the IPC used to communicate between location module and the Location daemon.
- lbs-server
  - lbs-server provides position, velocity, NMEA, and satellite information by communicating with a GPS chip.
  - lbs-server has the following functionalities:
    - Initializes and deinitializes the GPS, opens and closes GPS applications.
    - Provides the position result for location library.
    - Location session management-determination for session termination based on session status.
    - Serial interface with the GPS receiver
    - Enables the GPS chipset to support standalone GPS positioning methods.
    - Supports the standalone operation mode.



### Porting OAL Interface

The GPS plugin is implemented based on the Tizen `lbs-server` for vendor specific GPS devices.

The GPS plugin is implemented as a shared library and the `lbs-server` loads a specific GPS plugin at runtime. A GPS plugin must be written with predefined interfaces.

The `lbs-server-plugin-dev` source package is installed on OBS by adding the following command in the package spec file.

```
BuildRequires: pkgconfig(lbs-server-plugin)

```

The `lbs-server-plugin-dev` package source files can be found in the following directories:

```
/usr/include/lbs-server-plugin/*.h
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/lbs-server-plugin.pc

```

The `gps_plugin_intf.h` header file includes the API interfaces for the communication between the `lbs-server` and its GPS plugin.

```
typedef struct {
    /* Initialize the plugin module and register callback function for event delivery */
    int (*init) (gps_event_cb gps_event_cb, void *user_data);
    /* Deinitialize the plugin module */
    int (*deinit) (gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);
    /* Request specific action to plugin module */
    int (*request) (gps_action_t gps_action, void *gps_action_data, gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);
} gps_plugin_interface;

```

```
const gps_plugin_interface *get_gps_plugin_interface();

```

The `get_gps_plugin_interface()` function must be exported in the GPS plugin. It gives the `gps_plugin_interface` structure to the `lbs-server`, and the `lbs-server` communicates by these interfaces. When the `lbs-server` is started, the GPS plugin is loaded and the `init()` function is called. At this moment, a GPS device must be initialized.

```
int (*init) (gps_event_cb gps_event_cb, void *user_data);

```

When `init()` function is called, the `gps_event_cb` is set. GPS events and data from a GPS device is delivered by the `gps_event_cb` registered call back function.

```
typedef int (*gps_event_cb) (gps_event_info_t *gps_event_info, void *user_data);

```

The following example describes the GPS events.

```
typedef enum {
    GPS_EVENT_START_SESSION = 0x0000, /* The session is started */
    GPS_EVENT_STOP_SESSION, /* The session is stopped */
    GPS_EVENT_CHANGE_INTERVAL, /* Change updating interval */
    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_POSITION = 0x0100, /* Bring up GPS position data */
    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_SATELLITE, /* Bring up GPS SV data */
    GPS_EVENT_REPORT_NMEA, /* Bring up GPS NMEA data */
    GPS_EVENT_SET_OPTION = 0x0200, /* The option is set */
    GPS_EVENT_GET_REF_LOCATION = 0x0300, /* Get the reference location for AGPS */
    GPS_EVENT_GET_IMSI, /* Get IMSI for identification */
    GPS_EVENT_OPEN_DATA_CONNECTION = 0x0400, /* Request opening data network connection */
    GPS_EVENT_CLOSE_DATA_CONNECTION, /* Request closing data network connection */
    GPS_EVENT_DNS_LOOKUP_IND, /* Request resolving host name */
    GPS_EVENT_AGPS_VERIFICATION_INDI, /* Verification indicator for AGPS is required */
    GPS_EVENT_FACTORY_TEST = 0x0500,/* Factory test is done */
    GPS_EVENT_ERR_CAUSE = 0xFFFF /* Some error is occurred */
} gps_event_id_t;

```

The GPS events contains specific GPS event data which is part of `gps_event_data_t` is delivered, see the `gps_plugin_intf.h`. When the `lbs-server` want to make a request to GPS device, the `request()` function is called.

```
int (*request) (gps_action_t gps_action, void *gps_action_data, gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);

```

Each request is classified by `gps_action_t`.

```
typedef enum {
    GPS_ACTION_SEND_PARAMS = 0x00,
    GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION,
    GPS_ACTION_STOP_SESSION,
    GPS_ACTION_CHANGE_INTERVAL,
    GPS_INDI_SUPL_VERIFICATION,
    GPS_INDI_SUPL_DNSQUERY,
    GPS_ACTION_START_FACTTEST,
    GPS_ACTION_STOP_FACTTEST,
    GPS_ACTION_REQUEST_SUPL_NI,
    GPS_ACTION_DELETE_GPS_DATA,
} gps_action_t;

```

With the standalone GPS (unassisted GPS), the `GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION` and `GPS_ACTION_STOP_SESSION` are mandatory actions. If the `GPS_ACTION_START_SESSION` is delivered, the GPS plugin starts the acquisition of satellites and reports the `GPS_EVENT_START_SESSION` event to the `lbs-server` by the `gps_event_cb` callback function. Once the acquisition is completed and position is fixed, its position should be delivered by the `gps_event_cb` with the `GPS_EVENT_REPORT_POSITION` event ID and the position data.

To shut down the `lbs-server`, deinitialize the GPS device with the `deinit()` function.

```
int (*deinit) (gps_failure_reason_t *reason_code);

```

- Addign a new GPS plugin



```
#define PLATFORM_PATH "/sys/devices/platform"
#define PLUGIN_PATH PLATFORM_PATH"/xxxxx_gps"

```

The `check_plugin_module(char* module_name)` function checks the access to available plugin in the `/sys/devices/platform` directory and the `load_plugin_module` loads the plugin during the boot up time.

## Geofence

The Geofence Manager API provides service related to geofence. A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area.

[![Geofence.png](https://wiki.tizen.org/images/5/58/Geofence.png)](./media/524px-Geofence.png)

You can to set a geofence with geopoint, Wi-Fi MAC address, and Bluetooth address. Notifications on events, such as changes in the service status are provided.

There are 2 kinds of places and fences:

- Public places and fences that are created by the MyPlace application can be used by all applications.
- Private places and fences that are created by a specified application can only be used by the same application.

Notifications can be received about the following events:

- Zone in when a device enters a specific area
- Zone out when a device exits a specific area
- Results and errors for each event requested by the geofence module

## Map Service

The Location Maps API (Maps API) allows you to create map-aware applications.

[![Mapservice.png](https://wiki.tizen.org/images/3/35/Mapservice.png)](./media/Mapservice.png)

The Maps API has the following features:

- Geocoder (geocoding and reverse geocoding)
- Places (search places)
- Routes (search directions)
- Map Widget (rendering map images)

The Maps API allows you to choose a map service provider to be included in the plugins.

### Porting OAL Interface

The Maps plugin is implemented as a shared library and the Maps framework loads a specific Maps plugin at runtime. A Maps plugin must be written with predefined interfaces. The `capi-maps-service-plugin-devel` source package is installed on OBS by adding the following command in the package specification file:

```
BuildRequires: pkgconfig(capi-maps-service-plugin-devel)

```

The `capi-maps-service-plugin-devel` package source files can be found in the following directories:

```
/usr/include/maps/maps_plugin*.h
/usr/include/maps/maps_*_plugin.h
/usr/include/maps/maps_extra_types.h

```

The `module.h` header file includes the API interfaces for the communication between the Maps and its plugin.

```
typedef struct _interface_s {
    /* Plugin dedicated functions */
    maps_plugin_init_f maps_plugin_init;
    maps_plugin_shutdown_f maps_plugin_shutdown;
    maps_plugin_get_info_f maps_plugin_get_info;

    maps_plugin_get_center_f maps_plugin_get_center;
    maps_plugin_capture_snapshot_f maps_plugin_capture_snapshot;
} interface_s;

```

These functions must be implemented and exported in the Maps plugin. To create a Maps handle classified by provider name string, the `maps_plugin_get_info()` function must provide the name. The name is recommended to be capitalized.

The Maps plugins are located in the `/usr/lib/maps/plugins` directory.

#### HERE Maps plugi

For now, the HERE Maps plugin is embedded on the platform basically, and the provider name is 'HERE'. To use this plugin, you must get the credential keys in the HERE developers site, "[https://developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/)". You may need to pay a fee according to the threshold.

For user consent demanded by HERE, the user consent application included in the HERE Maps plugin is launched at first time of use if not agreed before.
