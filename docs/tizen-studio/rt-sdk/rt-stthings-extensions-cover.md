# SmartThings&trade; Extension

## Dependencies
- Ubuntu Only

The Tizen Studio for RT provides many extended features for SmartThings&trade;-connected IoT applications.

You can select a device model template from the Project Wizard and create a project that, by default , contains a lot of stub code for easy development. You only need to add user-defined logic or hardware-specific I/O control.

The Tizen Studio for RT supports the [OCF](https://openconnectivity.org) (Open Connected Foundation) resource model. You can view and modify the resource model in the Model Manager.

To develop IoT applications with SmartThings&trade;:

* [Create a SmartThings&trade; project](rt-create-smartthings.md).
* [Build the SmartThings&trade; project](rt-build-smartthings.md).
* [Manage devices and resources](rt-model-manager.md) through the Model Manager.
