# MIC Image Creator

MIC is an image creator. It's used to create images for Tizen.  With the MIC tool, users can **create images** of different types for different verticals, including live CD images, live USB images, raw images for KVM, loop images for IVI platforms, and fs images for chrooting.  Also, users can **chroot **into an image using MIC's enhanced chroot command. Besides, MIC enables **converting an image** to another image format, a very useful function for those sensitive to image format. Before going into details of MIC, we recommend reading the [Setup Development Environment](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/developer-guide/environment-setup) pages.
