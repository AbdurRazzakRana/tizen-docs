# Tizen Open Source Project

Tizen is an open source software stack created for a wide array of devices with different form factors. The primary purposes of Tizen are to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality and to introduce a successful, real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users.

We also wanted to make sure there was no central point of failure, where one industry player could restrict or control the innovations of any other. The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.

The Tizen operating system comes in multiple profiles to serve different industry requirements. The current Tizen profiles are Tizen IVI (in-vehicle infotainment), Tizen Mobile, Tizen TV, and Tizen Wearable. In addition to that, as of Tizen 3.0, all profiles are built on top of a common, shared infrastructure called Tizen Common.

With Tizen, a device manufacturer can begin with one of these profiles and modify it to serve their own needs, or use the Tizen Common base to develop a new profile to meet the memory, processing and power requirements of any device and quickly bring it to market.

Mobile operators can work with device partners to customize the operating system and user experience to meet the needs of specific customer segments or demographics.

For application developers and ISVs, Tizen offers the power of native application development with the flexibility of unparalleled HTML5 support. Tizen also offers the potential for application developers to extend their reach to new “smart devices” running Tizen, including wearables, consumer electronics (TVs, gaming consoles, DVRs, etc.), cars and appliances.

The Tizen project resides within the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/labs/tizen) and is governed by a Technical Steering Group. The Technical Steering Group is the primary decision-making body for the open source project, with a focus on platform development and delivery, along with the formation of working groups to support device verticals.

The [Tizen Association](http://www.tizenassociation.org/) has been formed to guide the industry role of Tizen, including gathering of requirements, identification and facilitation of service models, and overall industry marketing and education.


## Before you begin

This is a getting started page for Tizen developers.
We recommend reading the [Development Workflow](work-flow.md) page first.

## Getting access

Developers can register for an account at: [https://www.tizen.org/user/register](https://www.tizen.org/user/register)

## Development work flow

Tizen developers use the git and [gbs command-line tools](../tools/gbs/gbs-overview.md) for most of their work.
Tizen source code is managed by [Gerrit](../tools/gerrit-usage.md), a code review system for Git-based projects. Source code cloning, development, and review are under ACL (Access Control Lists). Make sure you get rights to access them.
