# Breathing Space

A screen that is full of design elements can be eye-catching, but it makes the user unable to focus on any specific item. Use screen space properly to guide the user's attention:

-   [Allow empty space](breathing-space/allow-empty-space.md) on the screen to improve the user experience.
-   [Prioritize and balance](breathing-space/prioritize-and-balance.md) content elements based on importance.
